Plagirism-Checker-using-KMP-Algorithm
=====================================

Plagiarism Detector using KMP Algorithm(Linear Time String Matching Algorithm) implemented in JAVA
Using the degeneration property of the KMP, common patterns were identified and plagiarism was detected
It is Efficient for processing very large files because it minimizes the total number of comparisons of the pattern against the input string
